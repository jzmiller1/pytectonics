# PyTectonics
This is an attempt to get [PyTectonics](http://pytectonics.sourceforge.net/) by [Carl Davidson](https://github.com/davidson16807) up and running on Python 3.7 with the latest version of numpy.  The original code hasn't been updated since 2015-07-27 and the author has moved on to [Tectonics.js](http://davidson16807.github.io/tectonics.js/).

The biggest challenge is the visual component of the code as it uses some original [vPython](http://vpython.org/) code from before the vPython 6/7 split that refocused vPython on the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

The original code is licensed under the version 2.0 Creative Commons Non Commercial Attribution License according to the [PyTectonics](http://pytectonics.sourceforge.net/) SourceForge site.
